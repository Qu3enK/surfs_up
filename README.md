# Surfs Up
Utilize SQLite and Python for analysis and visualization of weather data for Surf Shop investors.

The purpose of the Surf and Shake Shop analysis is to analyze the weather data in Oahu for June and December across several years to present to investor, W. Avy. The analysis would assist us in determining if the weather will impact the surfing and ice cream shop on the island.



## Results
The analysis of the weather data across several years yields the following:
- The average temperature for June and December is 75 and 71 degrees, respectively.
- The high temperatures for June and December are close at 85 and 83 degrees.
- The temperatures for June and December for the 75% are inline at 77 and 74, respectively.

## Summary
Based on the results of the analysis, the temperature for June December time period are ideal for the surf and ice cream shop. However we do not want to put all our ice cream in one cone.

We have some recommendations on additional queries to execute:
1. Review the precipitations data for each weather station to determine if the impact would be beneficial or not for business.
2. Review of the offshore winds, tide conditions and swells to determine optimal surfing conditions.

By executing the additional queries would provide further insights on where to open the surf shop as well as the success of the venture. It would be ideal to consider the others factors and not just depend on the temperature.
