A visual depiction of the analysis show that the fares generated is fairly steady acorss the 3 areas.  There is a slight spike for each City type towards the end of February going into March. Also, there is a uptick of fares during April for the Rural area; which may be due to the spring time.  The chart also supports the summary in Figure 1, that the Urban area generated more revenue than Rural and Suburban areas.

### Conclusion
- The Rural area appears to be the most underserved neighborhood and customers pay a more expensive fare compared to the Suburban or Urban area.
- The drivers in Urban area generate the most revenue between January thru April timeframe, however earn less than drivers in the other 2 areas.


## Summary
Based on the results of the analysis, we have some recommendations:
1. Provide additional drivers to the Rural area as they are the most underserved area.
2. Increase the rate for drivers in Urban area as they generated the most revenue.
3. As the Rural area has been identified as the most underserved area, it may prove beneficial to perform a survey to determine the demand for rideshare. Depending on the survey results will assist in determining if additional drivers need to be added to the area.
4. Expand the data analysis to include a full year, this would provide additional insight into fare revenue, ridership, fare per driver and assist in decision-making.
